🧬 Anoma

Anoma is a decentralized protocol for intent-based coordination that allows users and applications to express what they want rather than how to execute it. Instead of submitting transactions to a specific chain or contract, users submit private intents that describe desired outcomes, which the network matches and settles without requiring direct interaction or synchronous execution.

At its core, Anoma enables a new coordination model where intents can be discovered, matched, and composed across users, applications, and chains, while preserving privacy and sovereignty. Execution and settlement are handled by external systems, allowing Anoma to remain chain-agnostic and execution-neutral.

Anoma supports use cases like private trading, cross-chain coordination, asynchronous swaps, and multi-party workflows that are difficult or impossible to express using traditional transaction-based blockchains.

What Anoma abstracts away
• Direct transaction construction
• Chain-specific execution logic
• Synchronous counterparty interaction
• Explicit routing and settlement paths
• Public exposure of user intent

The result is a coordination layer that enables private, flexible, and composable interactions across the crypto stack, unlocking new market structures and application designs without forcing users or developers to commit to a single execution environment.
