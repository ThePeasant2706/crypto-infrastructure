🐄 CoW DAO

CoW DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization building trading infrastructure that protects users, optimizes execution, and minimizes harmful MEV extraction in DeFi. At its core is CoW Protocol, a permissionless meta-DEX aggregator that uses intent-based trading and batch auctions to find better prices, reduce gas costs, and shield users from frontrunning and other MEV attacks.  ￼

CoW DAO also supports products like CoW Swap (user-friendly trading interface), MEV Blocker (MEV protection RPC), and CoW AMM (a liquidity pool designed to protect providers from loss-versus-rebalancing).  ￼

What CoW DAO abstracts away
	•	Fragmented DEX liquidity sources
	•	Direct exposure to MEV adversarial ordering
	•	Inefficient price routing across venues
	•	Gas-inefficient trade execution

The result is a trading infrastructure that delivers fairer prices, better execution, and protection from common automated trading exploits while allowing users and liquidity providers to interact with DeFi without unnecessary friction.
