# Protocols

This directory contains individual breakdowns of crypto infrastructure protocols.

Each protocol folder includes diagrams and written explanations covering:
- Where the protocol sits in the stack
- What it abstracts away
- How it composes with other infrastructure

Protocols are documented independently first. Higher-level categorizations
(e.g. execution, messaging, sequencing) may be layered on later as patterns emerge.
