Espresso Systems

Espresso is a shared sequencing layer that provides neutral, decentralized transaction ordering for rollups and appchains.

Instead of each chain operating its own centralized sequencer, rollups can outsource ordering to Espresso while retaining full control over execution, state, and settlement.

Espresso focuses on ordering, not execution. It produces a canonical transaction order that multiple chains can rely on, enabling stronger decentralization guarantees and new forms of cross-rollup coordination.

What Espresso abstracts away
	•	Centralized sequencer trust assumptions
	•	Per-rollup sequencer infrastructure
	•	Sequencer MEV capture and ordering bias
	•	Coordination complexity between independent rollups

The result is fairer transaction ordering, improved decentralization, and a shared coordination layer that rollups can opt into without sacrificing sovereignty.
