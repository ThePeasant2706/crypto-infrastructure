🛠 FaroSwap

FaroSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) natively built on the Pharos Network to provide efficient, deep liquidity and seamless token swaps with low fees and fast transaction finality. It combines automated market maker (AMM) mechanics with enhanced liquidity provisioning models to deliver smooth trading for users and attractive yield opportunities for liquidity providers. ￼

FaroSwap supports various flexible liquidity pool types and leverages the Pharos Network’s high throughput and low cost to make DeFi trading more accessible and scalable. Users can swap assets directly from liquidity pools, earn rewards through staking and farming, and participate in community governance with the native FARO token. ￼

What FaroSwap abstracts away: 
• Fragmented liquidity across isolated DEXs 
• High gas costs typical of congested chains 
• Slow execution and pending confirmations 
• Complexity of traditional AMM interactions

The result is a user-friendly, performant DEX experience with deep pools, fast settlement, and optimized price execution that empowers traders and liquidity providers on the Pharos Network without unnecessary friction.
