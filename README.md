# Crypto Infrastructure

A public, evolving collection of diagrams and written explanations that map how modern
crypto infrastructure fits together.

This repository focuses on foundational layers such as execution, routing, messaging,
sequencing, settlement, and cross-chain abstractions across L1s, L2s, rollups, and appchains.

Content here is intended to clarify *where* protocols sit in the stack, *what* they abstract,
and *how* they compose with other infrastructure, not to promote tokens or make market claims.

This is a living reference. Diagrams and explanations may evolve as architectures and
protocols change.
